## A/B Test

> This Data science project was proposed by Udacity in the classes, in this project we created an A/B Project!

> A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important to get some practice working with the difficulties of these. A/B testing is a powerful technique used to compare the performance of two versions of a webpage or app. By randomly showing one version (A) to some users and another version (B) to others, you can measure which one performs better in terms of conversion rates, user engagement, or other key metrics

> For this project, we will working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
